"""CHANGELOG release-PR validator.

Mirrors the gate used in the sister polily repo, adapted for the master-only
branching model in polily-plugin (no long-lived `dev` branch — feature PRs
go straight to master, every PR is potentially a release PR).

Enforces the CHANGELOG discipline bits that git tags can't cover and
memory-based checklists have repeatedly failed:

1. The topmost section is a versioned release like `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD`,
   NOT `## [Unreleased]`. Catches the "forgot to rename [Unreleased]"
   class of mistake.

2. Every released version listed in the footer uses `releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`
   URL format, not `compare/vA...vB`. Consistent with the sister repo's
   convention (avoids the compare-format outlier polily once shipped).

3. `[Unreleased]` footer link compares against the *current* top released
   version, not a stale one.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_changelog.py [CHANGELOG.md]

Exits 0 on pass, 1 on any rejection. Errors printed to stderr so CI logs
show them prominently. Pure stdlib — no install step required.
